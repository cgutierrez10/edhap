Will implement dual account budgetting software. One account line is actual and one account line is budgetted.

Planning to make this as a rolling window budgetting tool rather than a fixed interval budget.

Otherwise broadly following common budgeting layout and workflow.

Basic files laying out the data table structure for budgeting software.
